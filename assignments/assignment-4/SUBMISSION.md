## Analysis
I used a rather basic implimentation of the design creating a container for the app to sit in and then a grid template to lay out the buttons. From there I had the buttons, onclick, call an append function that simply appends that character to the end of the expression the user was creating. When a clear entry is pressed, it slices off the last character from the expression. A nice comfort feature I added as well is after the user pressed = and gets their result, the next time they press any buttons the previous result is automatically clear and the new character take their place without having to manually clear after every evaluation. 
 
## Lessons Learned
CSS continues to be a bit tricky for me as I find myself waisting time away trying to get content to properly center or what properties go to what other properities. Something I likely will have to practice further.
