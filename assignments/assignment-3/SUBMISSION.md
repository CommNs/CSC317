# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
One of the obvious advantages of handwriting CSS is the creartive ability to make tiny tweaks and finnicy changes easily as the person is writing it. A human can much better organize things such as using global variable names or having a better inate understanding of the html the css will be applying to. The upsides of using AI in comparison is obviously the speed and ease of creation. It allows a designer to quickly iterate many different wildly different designs. The downsides are that the AI doesn't necessarily understand what kind of design the user is going for and can make logic errors a human likely wouldn't. Also due to the nature of how current generativeAI work, they are likely to produce 'samey' results based on whatever common design patterns were aparent in their training set. They also have a tendency toward hallucinating things like selectors that don't exist or properities that are irrelevent to the context. Ultimately, the I think the best approach currently lies in leveraging both AI and human expertise. AI can serve as a powerful starting point, automating repetitive tasks and can rapidly create test versions, while human designers refine and customize the output to align with specific project needs, as well as acting as a logic checker to make sure the structure of the CSS doesn't get out of hand and is still maintainable.
 
## Lessons Learned
Moving foward I need to keep track of my time better and study up on the differences in aligning content, self, items, justifying content, self, items etc.
All of which tripped me up often. 

## Preferred Version
I like mine dispite my lack of styling for the forms and charts because I enjoyed the creative process of making it but ultimately its undercooked. The Ai version is much more professional looking in comparison.
